Practice 3: Python Functions and Object-Oriented Programming
Overview
This practice focuses on mastering Python functions, lambda expressions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. You'll learn to create reusable code, perform quick operations with lambdas, and build classes with inheritance.

Learning Objectives:

Define and use functions with various argument types
Apply lambda functions with built-in functions like map(), filter(), and sorted()
Create classes, objects, and methods
Implement inheritance and method overriding
Organize code in a proper project structure
